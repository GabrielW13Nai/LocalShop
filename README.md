# Description

LocalShop App is an inventory App that can help with stock taking, generation and visualization of weekly, monthly and annual reports.

## User Story
The app has multiple users, including the merchant, admin and clerk

Clerks
The clerks are responsible for taking records of:
- The number of items received
- The status of payment(paid or not paid), lthis is important for procurement processes.
- The number of items in stock.
The number of items spoilt( Broken, expired and anything else).
- Buying and selling price.

Admin
The store admin should be able:
- To see a detailed report on the performance of individual entries.
- To see the products that suppliers have been paid and those not yet - this should be well separated to ensure ease of viewing.
- To change the payment status to paid for the products that were not paid - Ideally this happens after the suppliers have been paid.
- To inactivate or delete a clerks account and as well add new clerks.
- As above mentioned the report should be in a good graphical representation; that is, linear graphs and bar graphs as a requirement - pie charts are totally optional.

Merchant
The merchant should be able to:
- Add an admin, deactivate and delete their accounts - PS deactivation is independent from deleting the account, it is important for probation purposes.
- Should be able to see a store by store report in well visualized graphs
